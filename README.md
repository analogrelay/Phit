Phit
====

PowerShell wrapper around git that adds useful commands. Think [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) for Windows

## PhAQ ... I mean FAQ

**Isn't posh-git already a thing?** Yes, and a wonderful thing! But this is a full wrapper around git. Just use "phit" where you would use "git" and you get extra commands. You should ALSO use posh-git!

**Doesn't 'hub' work on Windows?** Yeah, but it requires Ruby. All Windowses come with PowerShells!

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to a folder called 'Phit' in your PowerShell Modules directory
 1. Don't know where that is? Open PowerShell and type '$env:PSModulePath' to see a ;-delimited list of directories you can put modules in.
2. Put "Import-Module Phit" in your PowerShell profile
3. Type "phit" to see the available commands!
